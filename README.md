# Project-2-ETL

Background (real world request with live data):
The purchasing and procurements department of a local company had been running their procurements process through a series of un-linked excel files, that were maintained and updated individually by two different employees.  In some cases, data was updated or duplicated in one file, but not updated with the same information in other files.  The process had become unwieldy, and the company suggested trying to use the original files to set up a database, which would facilitate addition of new entries in the future, while ensuring updates to all tables with any new information.
